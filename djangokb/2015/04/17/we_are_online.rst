This blog intends to be a public, github-hosted knowledge base for sharing Django, Python and Javascript
solutions and approaches that we all get confronted with day by day.

The motivation behind this blog is to share our knowledge of professional software development - from
tipps and tricks to everything that might be helpful regarding web application development.

This blog was initiated by Toni Michel,
cofounder of the stuttgart-based development firm `schnapptack <http://schnapptack.de>`_ and Christian Bergmiller
lead developer of `Gildemeister Energy Efficiency <http://energy.gildemeister.com/>`_.
